# Description

Help the child grow was a class project I did which captures an organization that partners with highschools to connect young high school graduates to
opportunities where they can further their studies or gain skills and experiences necessary for their growth. It does this by capturing information about the students and their high school and then use this information to match them with the available study abroad opportunities. Also it details the opportunities available such as the name and type of opportunity,the start date and the duration it would take to go through the opportunity. Help the child grow also provides resources such as books, videofiles, audio files, software and hardware (e.g printing services) that students can use as they prepare students for admission into these opportunities. These resources are controlled by the various counselors. HTCG guides teachers on how they can serve as recommenders to the students as well as providing students with a list of Volunteering services they can apply for to help boost the applicants legibility and experience. All the activities of HTCG are geared towards successfully enrolling a student into a study abroad opportunity or enabling the student secure a job offer.

Technical Components: 
Implemented a low fidelity privilege authorization, whereby some users like the counselors have priviledges to delete, update or create new items in the database, but other users like students can only view information available in the database.
